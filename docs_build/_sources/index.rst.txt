Introduction
------------
Requirements driven search-based testing (also known as falsification) has proven to be a practical and effective method for discovering erroneous behaviors in Cyber-Physical Systems. Despite the constant improvements on the performance and applicability of falsification methods, they all share a common characteristic. Namely, they are best-effort methods which do not provide any guarantees on the absence of erroneous behaviors (falsifiers) when the testing budget is exhausted. The absence of finite time guarantees is a major limitation which prevents falsification methods from being utilized in certification procedures. In this paper, we address the finite-time guarantees problem by developing a new stochastic algorithm. Our proposed algorithm not only estimates (bounds) the probability that falsifying behaviors exist, but also it identifies the regions where these falsifying behaviors may occur. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on standard benchmark functions from the optimization literature and on the F16 benchmark problem.

However, SBT techniques do not provide guarantees on correctness if no falsifying behavior is found within the test budget. Hence, the applicability of SBT methods for evidence generation supporting assurance cases is limited. In this work, we make progress towards developing finite-time guarantees for SBT techniques with associated confidence metrics. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to the F16 GCAS benchmark challenge.},
